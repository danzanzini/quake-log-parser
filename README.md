# Quake Log Parsing Application

This Ruby application parses a Quake game log file and generates a report with information about kills.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Ruby installed on your system.
2. Run bundle install to install dependencies
3. Place the Quake game log file in the `resources` directory with the name `quake_logs.txt`.
4. Run `rake run` to execute the application.
5. Run `rake test` to run the tests.

## Improvements
- Test coverage. Several use cases were implemented during the development but edge cases were not covered.
